My method avoids many pitfalls related to deploying standard content security polices by using hashes to create a possibly strict policy.

Later I try to evaluate my approach by means of 

Unfortunatelly my work does not fully automatic on all hosts.
Yet it still may prove beneficial to a few hosts which are already concernced about their security.

I hope that my way of using report only header may inspire others to create similar tools
