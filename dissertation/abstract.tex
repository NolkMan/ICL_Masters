Cross site scripting attacks are one of many ways a malicious JavaScript file can be included in the users browser. 
Scripts provide attackers a fully automatic framework to exfiltrate user data or to perform actions in the name of an unsuspecting victim.
As clients expect more features to be available online, browsers contain more sensitive information than ever before.
Services such as banks and payment services spend significant amount of resources to guarantee the security of their services.
Testing through different test suites to ensure significant coverage of their code, or hiring dedicated security specialists to manually test their live product are among many ways such companies try to protect their clients from exposing their data.
Many of those methods work by performing an exhausive search on the host. 
The goal of this work is to develop an autonomous server which persistently scans for new and modyfied scripts running on the hosts website.
By using Content Security Policy Report Only, the server may involve genuine users to guarantee maximum coverage.
By exclusively using the non enforcing version of CSP the server can achieve the highest form of security without compromising user experience or hindering development of new features.
